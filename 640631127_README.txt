Objective
Our task is to impliment the KNN model without using libraries which classifies the new species based on the sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset
Iris dataset is available in scikit-learn.
There are 150 observations with four input consists of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width variables and one output variable is a class label for each instance.

Setup
In order to create a program that predicts the class of iris dataset , we need to use some very useful python packages. You will need to install the following packages:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn
4. Statistics
If you do not already have some of these packages you can install them through pip install PACKAGE.

Description
Our program will start by importing required packages and we have created the KNN function for impliment any data which is broken down into 3 parts as Calculate Euclidean Distance,
, Get Nearest Neighbors and Make Predictions functions. Then we test the program with Iris dataset as following steps: 1) Importing the Libraries 2) Loading the Iris-Flower dataset
3) Split data into training and testing 4) Training and Predicting from KNN classifier we created before and finally 5) Compare classification performance with/without using sklearn

Example of program input:
There are four inputs as follow:
Sepal length in cm.
Sepal width in cm.
Petal length in cm.
Petal width in cm.
Example Data = [4.5, 2.3, 1.3, 0.3]

Example of program output:
There are one input is a Class as y_hat which shown in dummy variables as follows:
[Iris-virginica] => 0
[Iris-setosa] => 1
[Iris-versicolor] => 2
Example Predicted: 1.0 => [Iris-setosa]
